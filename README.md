<h1>hotel booking site</h1>
this is a way for people to book hotels in a fast efficient manner,
it has four sections
<ul>
## xplore
<p>this just  there for aethstics, it does have our core belief of the services we provide
## hotels
this has a search bar that searches for the hotel. it uses two fetch methods, one to get the id of the hotel, the
second is a post request that also post the data and gets back the hotel photos
<li>rviews</li>
this also uses the same fetch request as the top section, it gets back reviews of the hotels above. it then renders the data to this section
<li>booking</li>
this takes in the user data and stores it in a database
</ul>
